					Women Empowerment Through Tourism TRAINING program
				</h1>
				<p>
					The WETS training program is  to empower women the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to thrive in Rwanda’s tourism industry. This comprehensive program consists of seven key modules, each addressing crucial aspects of tourism, customer service, digital marketing, hospitality, tour guiding, entrepreneurship, and safety. The curriculum balances theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice, preparing women to engage professionally in various tourism roles or to launch their own tourism-related businesses. Each course within the program builds foundational skills while fostering self-reliance, leadership, and professionalism. Spanning approximately 23 weeks, WETS aims to create pathways for women to become influential contributors to Rwanda’s tourism sector, promoting sustainable tourism practices, local heritage appreciation, and economic growth.

					The program includes interactive workshops, scenario-based exercises, and real-life case studies, allowing participants to gain a robust understanding of the tourism industry and its various components. The WETS training emphasizes not only practical skills but also values of customer care, cultural sensitivity, and environmental stewardship, crucial for modern tourism. By the end of the program, participants will be fully equipped to either pursue job opportunities in established tourism companies or confidently start their own ventures, contributing to Rwanda’s national goals of economic independence and gender equality in the workforce.
